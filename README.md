Educational Resource: SecureChat serves as an educational tool for cryptography enthusiasts, offering insights into various encryption techniques and their practical applications in securing communication channels.

Implementation:

Python Programming: SecureChat is developed using Python, leveraging its extensive libraries for cryptography and Tkinter for GUI development.
Tkinter GUI: The graphical user interface is designed using Tkinter, providing users with an intuitive and responsive platform for encryption and decryption operations.
Modular Design: The project follows a modular design approach, allowing for easy integration of additional encryption algorithms and enhancements to existing functionalities.
Cross-Platform Considerations: While initially targeted for Windows, SecureChat's design considers portability to other operating systems, ensuring flexibility and compatibility across platforms.


Usage:

Launch SecureChat on a Windows system.
Use the intuitive Tkinter interface to select the desired encryption algorithm (e.g., Caesar Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Vigenère Cipher).
Input the plaintext message and encryption key (if required) in the designated fields.
Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message securely.
The encrypted ciphertext will be displayed on the GUI.
To decrypt a ciphertext, input the encrypted message along with the decryption key (if required) and select the corresponding decryption algorithm.
Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the ciphertext and view the original plaintext message.
Enjoy secure communication and data protection with SecureChat.
Conclusion:
SecureChat, with its intuitive Tkinter interface and support for multiple encryption techniques, offers a robust solution for secure communication on Windows platforms.
